### Editing My Creative Task 
Click on the folder named "Creative Task" and in there are four files, <br>

<b u>SPOILER - Character Sheet and Plot.pdf:</b>    This has what a planned out before I wrote anything (I tried just going for it and it felt illegal) <br>
<b u>SPOILER FREE - Character Sheet.pdf:</b>        Basic character sheet to keep track of everyone, and see what I was picturing when describing them <br>
<b u>Creative Narrative RD - HONR 391.pdf:</b>      You can read the story right here, <br>
<b u>Creative Narrative RD - HONR 391.docx:</b>     You can download this File to edit my terrible grammar. 

Work on this at your leisure (though its due on the 23rd but I can request up to five extensions), I put all of my built up creative power from the 
last 19 years of my life into this. I want total transparency if you think the story blows hot monkey oil, then please tell me, and give suggestions on how to fix it.
I did make it pretty long, the word requirment was only 3,000 and I'm at 7,000 and there's still a lot I need to add. Also more opinions are helpful, so if there are 
other people that are willing to read it that'd be splendid.

If you have any other questions just text or call
